# fleet2kubes

Converts fleet systemd units to kubernetes resources.

## Background

Cogo Labs adopted Docker early in 2014 and leveraged CoreOS Fleet to deploy and manage a rich distributed microservices platform. Kubernetes, based on Google's internal manager, Borg, matured to production-ready quality in 2018, and has fully absorbed CoreOS Fleet technologies, such as `etcd` (backend for the Kubernetes Control Plane), into an awesome ecosystem now led by the CNCF. This minimal glue automates parts of our Kubernetes migration.

## Caveats

While it works well for generic pipework-based web services, does not yet handle:
- most docker flags eg. privilege
